 A note regarding task 3:
some countries, like the netherlands (that appeared in the assignment
example), have multiple covid19 records per day.
for instance,
https://api.covid19api.com/country/Netherlands?from=2021-01-07T00%3A00%3A00&to
=2021-01-08T00%3A00%3A00,
will include a records for the netherlands mainland but also several records
for each dutch territories.
when considering active & confirmed cases of country per day, i chose to
consider only the mainland data (where province attribute is "").


2.
    A short explanation regrading the subscribers data saved (tasks 4+5):
I chose to implement and handle the subscribers data in the following
manner:

creating a .json file for each country, which will hold subscribers info by
date and by mail (which is unique):

e.g in israel's subscribers file, we can have:
{date_x: {email_x: [{route_a, route2_b, route_c], email_y: [{route_z}]}

(if we look for potential infected subscribers by a confirmed case
in day x in italy, we will look for only in the italy subscribers file, then
according to day x key, etc).

* Assuming a single subscriber can attempt multiple routes per day (and
transmit them separately), I chose to implement the value of a subscriber as an
array of routes per each subscriber(and therefore the [] in the above example).
